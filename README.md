The Lark sits between your printer and it's RAMPSish LCD/SD card board and provides a fast and easy to use web 
interface for printing from SD cards. 

It "just works" with most printers/firmwares that support the "LCD Smart Display" style 2-line text LCD.

With minor tweaks, it should work with any printer that supports Marlin.
